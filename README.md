<h1>GitHub Desktop V2</h1>

This is a sample application that functions similarly to GitHub Desktop. This is a project for the CSC109 class, where it allows the user to enter in a folder from their filepath and initialize it as a Github Repo.

It creates an initial commit, a local Git repo, and a remote GitHub repo. An initial commit is pushed to the repo and the user is then provided with the link to their repo.
